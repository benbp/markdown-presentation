## Markdown (.md)

#### Or, what are all these .md files supposed to be?

---

#### Lightweight Markup Language
*machines can read it, humans can too*

Simple syntax for  
**styling** and `formatting`  
text and *conversion* to ![HTML](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Old_HTML_Logo.svg)

```

NOTE:  

- It is a LML
- fancy term for machine readable, human readable
- primarily a way to write text that can get converted to html

## Why

*"The overriding design goal for Markdownâ€™s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible."*  

*https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/*

NOTE:  
- Originally created in 2004 by John Gruber.
- Goal of to be easily readable by humans, compared to writing raw html, etc.
- "publishable as-is", you can publish a raw markdown doc

### Common uses

VSTS, Github Pull Request/Issue/Work Item descriptions

- It is a LML

# Why

*"The overriding design goal for Markdownâ€™s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible."*  
*https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/*

NOTE:  
- Originally created in 2004 by John Gruber.
- Goal of to be easily readable by humans, compared to writing raw html, etc.
- "publishable as-is", you can publish a raw markdown doc
- Has since grown into many implementations, variants, uses, especially in OSS ecosystem
  - vsts, github pull requests, stack overflow comments, wiki
  - text editors, note-taking software
  - one of the most common formats in OSS eco for READMEs, docs
